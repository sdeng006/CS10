# My CS10 working files

Hi! Welcome to my github. 

I can say that was my first time to code when I took this class. 

The class made me feel very confortable about touching with the keyboard. 

Even though that was only a cmd window, this class led me to the new world of computer.

## What the lines of something for...

CS10 in my college teaches students basic use of C++. Each lab or assignment is for a beginner to follow up the class step by step, such as use of vector and array and avoiding of any kind of code can cause different kinds of errors.

### Examples

#### Hello World!

I don't know if it is a ceremony to begin a new programming language. Trying to open your eye when crying out, you are new here and like a baby. "Hello World" is your first sound of weeping in new languages. At least, I am happy to take it like this. 

Anyway, let's talk about the very first step.

```
cout << "Hello World!" << endl; // show up Hello World!
```

This is a basic line of code to have these words **_and a new line_** in your terminal or cmd tool. The comments after "//" will not affect this line of code before.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
